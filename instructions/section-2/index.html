Karen Montalvo
About:
    Hello, my name is Karen and I am 22 years old! I currently live in NC and I enjoy trying new foods and going on random trips with my siblings and friends.
    One of my current goals is to complete my CTD classes and to find a job in the IT field.

Experience: 
    Currently I do not have a lot of experience when it comes to software development, but I hope to gain more experience during this class.
    I do have experience in translating and talking to different people of various backgrounds. I have also helped with my dad's business by
    making sure we have the necessary materials for each job and making sure to communicate with the clients to make sure their needs are met.
